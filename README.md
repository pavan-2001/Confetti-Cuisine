# Confetti-Cuisine

* It is a fully designed web application using **Node.js**, **MongoDB** .
* This application shows how to save application data through the minimum database theory needed to connect a database. 
* The data is organized using mongoose models. 
* I've used MVC (Modal-View-Controller) architecture. 
* It has a proper application of CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations. 
* Every user is authenticated and it allows only unique users to Sign Up for and log into the application.
* I've added sessions and cookies to this application to allow information's to be shared between application server and the user's computer.
* I've extended my application to serve data in other way's beyond the web page.These alternative data avenues enable my application to connect with external services that might use my application's data.
* I've used that API by creating a pop-out window with a list of data accessed through an API endpoint. 
* I secured my API by creating an API token system.
* There is a fully functioning live-chat feature in my application that allow users to connect to one another.
